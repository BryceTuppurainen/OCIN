Obscure Character Identification Network

This is a very simple neural network (the first I've personally designed from scratch) that I'm using to practice using the associated libraries for other projects. 
Please feel free to copy, adapt, modify this code as you like! It's based on a Sigmoid Neuron network that can perform some basic backpropogation
to train against the MNIST database/s see the link below.
