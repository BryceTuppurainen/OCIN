Obscure Character Identification Network

This is a very simple neural network (the first I've personally created with pytorch) that I'm using to practice using the associated libraries for other projects 
with the NUbots team.

I've currently trained this network with a few hundred epochs of the dataset, should be >99% accurate at this point but can still improve.

Please feel free to copy, adapt, modify this code as you like! It's based on a 3-hidden layer network that can perform some basic backpropogation
to train against the MNIST database/s, see the link below.
